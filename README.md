Swip-nav is a Touch friendly navigation.

Simply add class="swipe-nav" to a nav element to make it work. Also, you must set the navigation position to the left or right by adding class="nav-left" or class="nav-right" to that same nav. For a drop down menu simply add .dropdown1 and increment each number each time( a max of ten is expected).
NOTE: In order for the swipe functinality to function, jQuery Mobile is required. The jQuery Mobile JS file (jquery.mobile.custom.min.js) is included in the download and is linked with the basic_template.html that is also included in the download.
